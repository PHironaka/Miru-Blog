Welcome to Miru, our quaint little corner of the internet we call home. Ray Bradbury once said, “Stuff your eyes with wonder, live as if you’d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories.” No other words could crystallize our intentions any better. It’s quite simple really: we want to see the world and document our adventures.
