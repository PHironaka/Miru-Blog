Welcome to Miru, our quaint little corner of the internet we call home. Ray Bradbury once said, “Stuff your eyes with wonder, live as if you’d drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It’s more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories.” No other words could crystallize our intentions any better. It's quite simple really: we want to see the world and document our adventures. In its most purest form, Miru is a Travel Journal. Join us as we venture to parts unknown as well as a few of our favorite places!

# The Crew

Miru is curated, updated, and coagulated by the dynamic duo of Kamauri Yeh and Peter Hironaka. That's us! We're in love and we love to travel the world with each other. Venice has been our home for nearly two years now, which has been an incredibly inspirational place to rest our heads.

As we continue to develop Miru, we're always on the lookout to collaborate with like minded folks. If you think you have an interesting (and relevant) story to share, or there's some hidden cave in the South of France you're dying to share photos of, please feel free to get in touch.

# Our Goal

To have fun with this! We're not setting out to create a News publication churning out hundreds of posts a week. That would be scary. We want to share our journeys with people who appreciate similar things.

# Miru?  

We wanted to choose a name that confused people. In truth, Miru in Japanese means 'see', which is appra po of our content strategy :)
