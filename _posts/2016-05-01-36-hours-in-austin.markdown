Our inaugural Austin adventure began at approximately 12:30am, which is around the time our LA flight arrived at Austin Bergstrom International Airport. Once we gathered our belongings and ventured through baggage claim, it was a straight bee line to 6th street aka Dirty aka where the Longhorns live and party. In truth, this condensed weekend trip was made to celebrate one of our good friend's birthdays. It was an absolute blast and we packed in a ton of fun little adventures into a 36 (more like 30) hour free for all, full of laughing, drinking and sightseeing.

Whenever I venture to a new city, there's typically three things I judge against its overall value: food, easily accessible (quality) recreation, and a  We were lucky enough to have a car all weekend, which is really the only way to get around Austin, I couldn't imagine how it would've been without one. My overall reaction to a weekend in Austin: it has a lot happening at all hours of the day. Beyond the internationally famed SXSW festival, there's tons of fun stuff to do. And best of all: everything is affordable! Here's a quick breakdown of everything we got to experience:

#Saturday

After a series of of late night shenannigans ensued, we quickly rallied Saturday morning to get some coffee and bites at a nearby coffee shop called Fleet. The interior is a beautiful and modern aesthetic, I felt like I was back home in Venice. I ordered a coffee and a migas taco, both of which did not disappoint. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely be rolling through here for a morning pick me up.  


We headed directly to West Austin to meet up with friends to, of course, eat more food. Paperboy is another really solid food truck/outdoor breakfast spot in Austin. I recommend the Hash bowl: it packs a ton of flavor and it's not too taxing on the stomach. From Paperboy we walked up 11th Street and stumbled into a cool little boutique called Take Heart. It's very reminiscent of Tortoise General Store in Venice, there's a lot of similar products in both places. It's definitely one of those places where I could buy pretty much everything that's for sale, unfortunately I only brought one small carry-on so I had to be a bit more pragmatic with my purchase (we settled on a candle). Take Heart is and awesome little shop, highly recommended stopping by. From there it was onto the next activity: Barton Springs. It was 95 degrees, and there honestly couldn't have been a better place to be in the blazing Texas humidity. It's a ginormous, sprawling man made rececreational swimming pool with fresh spring water, stretching as far as the eye can see (approximately 3 acres). After drying off on the hillside, it was time for our next adventure which included large quantities of Lone Star beer and one particularly flimsy party bus.

We hit up a bunch of bars all throughout the night, most of them were pretty crowded. Probably the most memorable stop along the magical caravan ride was at one place called Mezcalería Tobalá. The small, darkly lit Oaxacan-style Mezcal bar is actually located above another bar but they're in no way connected. The energy in the bar can best be described as 'chill'. And there's live entertainment, which comes in the form of a Spanish Guitar. This was my favorite stop of the night, naturally, as I was able to regroup and relax before we moved onto the crazy scene down at 6th street. I'll just leave it at that.

#Sunday

Go slow Sunday in full effect. After a full night of partying, we needed to sleep it off, but we quickly rallied and headed into town for some morning java. On the way, we stopped by the famed Graffitti park at Castle Hills. There were a few people actually tagging certain areas of the park while we were there, which was pretty cool. I honestly wish more cities had something like this, where folks can run wild in a controlled environment as opposed to defacing city property. The coffee shop we ended up stopping by is a place called Picnik, which is a coffee shop built inside a shipping container. Their hot ticket item is the grass-fed butter coffee w/ triglyceride oil for that extra punch of protein. I'm not typically a fan of anything other than BLACK, but this was pretty tasty.

Before our flight back home, we gathered the troops and headed straight to a great mexican restaurant called Baby Acapulco. We sat outside under the blue tarp and stuffed our faces with the best Queso, Guac and mole of the weekend. The Migas
