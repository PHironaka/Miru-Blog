This year we were thankful for many things, and to culminate it all, we were able to spend a very special Thanksgiving in Hawaii.

WHERE: Kauai, Hanalei Bay, Hawaii

WHEN: November 2016

STAY: Hanalei Tiki Home

MIRU MOMENT: Secret Beach

MIRU ITINERARY

* Make sure you get to Ke'e Beach early, around 7:30-8am. The parking lot gets full and you'll be able to avoid foot traffic on the trail.

* At the very least, bring a good pair of sneakers with traction for the hike. You'll run across a few die hards climbing with bare feet: don't be one of these people.

* Bring a nice camera to capture the beautiful surroundings!
