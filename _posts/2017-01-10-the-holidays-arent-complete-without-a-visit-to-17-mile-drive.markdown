It has become a tradition in recent years for our family to celebrate my Mom's birthday at Pebble Beach. For those of you who don't know, 17 mile Drive is home to some of the greatest golf courses in the world. My father and I decided to shake the rust off the sticks and give it a go. We played Spyglass Hill, which is one of my all time favorite courses to play. Even though are scores were nothing to write home about we still had a blast chopping it around. 

WHERE: Pebble Beach, California

WHEN: December 2016

STAY: The Lodge at Pebble Beach

MIRU MOMENT: Secret Beach

MIRU ITINERARY

* Make sure you get to Ke'e Beach early, around 7:30-8am. The parking lot gets full and you'll be able to avoid foot traffic on the trail.

* At the very least, bring a good pair of sneakers with traction for the hike. You'll run across a few die hards climbing with bare feet: don't be one of these people.

* Bring a nice camera to capture the beautiful surroundings!
