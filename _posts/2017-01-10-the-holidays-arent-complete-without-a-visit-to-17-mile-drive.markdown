It has become a tradition in recent years for our family to celebrate my Mom's birthday at Pebble Beach. For those of you who don't know, 17 mile Drive is home to some of the greatest golf courses in the world. My father and I decided to shake the rust off the sticks and give it a go. We played Spyglass Hill, which is one of my all time favorite courses to play. Even though are scores were nothing to write home about we still had a blast chopping it around. 

WHERE: Pebble Beach, California

WHEN: December 2016

STAY: The Lodge at Pebble Beach

MIRU ITINERARY

* Pebble Beach and Spyglass are both world class golf courses. Make sure to check for special discounts on Pebble Beach's newsletter, as we were able to play Spy at a significantly lower rate. Oh, and bring your A game, you're gonna need it.

* Lodge guests have exclusive access to The Beach Club which is a private club complete with a full gym and olympic sized swimming pool.
