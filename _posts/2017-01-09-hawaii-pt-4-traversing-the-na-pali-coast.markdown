The mud slide continues, this time alongside the majestic Na Pali Coast. Kauai is home to one of the wettest places on the planet, and we just so happened to be visiting during rainy season. Rain \+ dirt = mud, you get the point. The Kalalau Trail is not groomed, either. Their are rocks, creeks, and narrow windy pathways to navigate. And although we got hit with most of the elements mother nature can provide, we still had a hell of a time.

WHERE: Kauai, Na Pali Coast, Hawaii

WHEN: November 2016

MIRU MOMENT: Hiking the Kalalau Trail to Hanakapiai Beach 

MIRU ITINERARY

* Make sure you get to Ke'e Beach early, around 7:30-8am. The parking lot gets full and you'll be able to avoid foot traffic on the trail.

* At the very least, bring a good pair of sneakers with traction for the hike. You'll run across a few die hards climbing with bare feet: don't be one of these people. 

* Bring a nice camera to capture the beautiful surroundings!
