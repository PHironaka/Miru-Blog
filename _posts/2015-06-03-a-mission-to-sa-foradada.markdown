Everyone likes bread. Right? Well, if you're one of those health nuts that only eats kale, please change the channel as I wax poetic on my favorite neighborhood spot: Superba Food & Bread. It's situated on the corner of Lincoln and Marco PL, which is a few hundred yards from my home. It's my go-to spot for a morning Croissant and Coffee.

LA Restauranteur and Dogtown Resident Paul Hibler opened Superba's doors in 2014, offering an assortment of Cafe, bakery and comfort foods. Their menu offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner options. The space, which was designed by Catherine Johnson and Rebecca Rudolph (also developed Superba's brand identity), is pretty unique in that the café is located in a separate area from the kitchen and bakery. There's a fun, youthful, vibrant energy that ruminates throughout the restaurant. Pops of green can be seen on the glass bakery display as well as on the tables and exterior of the kitchen.

And the food? Well, let me just say there's something for everyone. If you've had a morning workout and feel like indulging in some coma inducing sugary sustenance, look no further than the Lots of Grain Hotcake. It's one of the most savory most delicious things I've ever eaten. My other favorite's are: And the food? Well, let me just say there's something for everyone.
