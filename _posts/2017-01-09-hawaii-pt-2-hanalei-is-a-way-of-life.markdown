There's a pace to Hanalei. Something that's unique from any other part of Kauai. It has nothing to do with the amount of activities you can do.  Anyone who's visited this part of the world can attest to how special of a place it truly is. You can pretty much walk to everything in town. Hanalei Bay beach is probably the nicest beach on the island. There's a Shaved Ice truck in town that's amazing. The people are friendly. Did I mention Shaved Ice?

Also, if you're looking to avoid the hustle and bustle of downtown (that's a joke), take a drive through the Rice Fields and step through yet another time warp in Kauai's history. It's extremely remote, there's only a few residents living back on that side of the island.
