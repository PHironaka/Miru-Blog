Hello folks, and welcome to Dogtown Daily!

I'm stoked to get this journey underway, but before we get into the nitty gritty,let me attempt to provide a forecast of things to come. Where this blog + site go from here is still up in the air, it could go in a number of different directions. As founder of this newfound internet real estate, what I promise to deliver first and foremost is authenticity. I want to give readers a 'locals only' glimpse into all the great things Venice has to offer. I want to honor and respect the community that has established itself long before I arrived while also extending the community beyond the 90291.

Secondly, I want to take this opportunity to learn more about my community of Venice. Gaining a certain level of historical context to how this town has been shaped will give me even more reasons to love this place (if that's possible).

There is no specific angle I'm choosing to filter through. This promises to be 100% DOGTOWN. I love my new (just passed my one year mark) hometown of Venice, and I want to share that passion with everyone who's interested in reading. Simple as that. What does that mean? Well, in all honesty, it could me a number of things. At this point, it's difficult to target exactly what that will entail, but the following list should cover the gammet of content I'm aiming to report:

#Venice Business(es)
There are so many great shops, restaurants,and cafes opening up on a regular basis, it seems only fitting this would become a category onto itself.

#The Great Outdoors
Nature vibes. Beaches, swell, trees, Canals.

#Architecture
Homes here are getting bigger, and the only constant I can find from the new and the old is vibrant. A lot of the big hitters have made their mark in our territory, and as an architectural enthusiast, I plan to heap praise on some of my favorite spots.


And with that, we begin...
