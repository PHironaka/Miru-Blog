Last weekend, Kam and I enjoyed hosting a few proud members of the Yeh Area: Shoj McGoge, Auntie O, and Christian, respectively.

As fate would have it, they visited during one of the foggiest weekends we've experienced in the three years we've lived in Venice. Despite the dreary (and bizarre) weather, we pressed forward.

WHERE: Venice, California

WHEN: March 2017

MIRU ITINERARY

* Breakfast at our favorite spot, Superba Food and Bread.
