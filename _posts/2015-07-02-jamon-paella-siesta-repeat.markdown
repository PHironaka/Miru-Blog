Before I return to normal California programming, I have to share about our memorable trip to Barcelona!

Peterâ€™s family had been planning this trip for quite some time to celebrateâ€™s his momâ€™s birthday. I was thankful to have been able to join, especially since I had never been to Spain. I have to say, Spaniards sure know how to live. From the jamon, paellas, siestas, life is GRANDE!

Below are some of my favorite places we stopped at, and hope youâ€™ll enjoy them to when you visit!

# Sagrada FamÃ­lia

We kicked off our first full day in Barcelona by visiting the incredibly iconic,  Sagrada FamÃ­lia. In 1883, GaudÃ­ was commissioned to architect this historic place of worship. GaudÃ­â€™s conception of the Sagrada Familia was based on the traditions of Gothic and Byzantine cathedrals. He was deeply inspired by nature, with light and color playing a central role.

It was pretty fun getting to see it for the first time with Peter and his mom, since they were the only ones who had been to see it before. They spoke about how they felt like they were seeing it for the first time since the work continues to evolve. I look forward to seeing it again in a few years and comparing the growth and remarkable additions that I know will be present.

# Tickets Bar

First off, I am one to advocate dessert before dinner. In that spirit, I have to tell you that this place has itâ€™s very own DESSERT ROOM! If you donâ€™t want to go here after hearing that, I am worried that our friendship no longer has a chance.

In 1991, Albert and Ferran AdriÃ  started their work with tapas in elBulli, and they turned this concept into something really important in their way to understand cooking. Since then, a continuous development has taken place.

It was truly like a show, a work of art. Waffles stuffed with cheese, strawberries dipped in flavor foam hanging from a bonsai tree, pinapple sorbet with coconut shavings. Sharing, talking, tasting, and everything in between can  happen at Tickets.

# La Boqueria

The Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria, also referred to as La Boqueria is a large public market in the Gothic Quarter. Word to the wise, it could be dangerous to walk through there if hungryâ€¦youâ€™ll want everything! La Boqueria is packed with people, all kinds of food, colors, and overall and amazing way to see and feel the Spanish culture.

# Park GÃ¼ell

Park GÃ¼ell is a public park located in Carmel Hill. Itâ€™s absolutely beautiful with itâ€™s gardens and design. The park was built between 1900 â€“ 1914, and was open to the public in 1926. Once again, GaudÃ­ was commissioned to work on it and through this project put into practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would be symbol of his organic style.

# Novedades & Domigos

![iimg_2310a.jpg](/uploads/img_2107.jpg)

Just two of the fun vintage shops in the Poblenou district. Wandering around there almost made me feel like I was in Portland again. Walking in there youâ€™ll find adorable cards, clothes, and homeware. I wish I could have packed it all home with me! I guess that just means Iâ€™ll have to go back some other time ðŸ˜Š

# Bar Mut

Last, but certainly not least, Peterâ€™s sister Kate took us to the most delicious place for lunch. Come here and have the tapas of your dreams!
