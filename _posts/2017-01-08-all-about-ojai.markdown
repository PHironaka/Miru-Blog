WHERE: Ojai, California 
WHEN: December 2016

After moving to California a few years ago, Ojai has quickly become one of our favorite weekend getaways. From the “pink” sunsets to incredible spa, there isn’t any other place like it. 

This past trip, we enjoyed Ojai’s holiday decorations, as well as fun pop-up’s that show up around this time of year. 

We hope you enjoy your visit and we promise you’ll leave more relaxed than ever!
