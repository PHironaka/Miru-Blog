Alright friends, I’ve been absolutely awful at keeping up with this blog! However, I decided that summer needed to bow out with a little post about The Parker.

First off, I’d say it’s fair to claim that it’s been one of the best summers by far. Getting to know this new city and having access to drive so many different places and meet new friends has been beyond memorable. When we first moved here, Peter and I made a list of places that we wanted to visit and explore, Palms Springs being one of them. Our schedules kept getting packed with things here and there so we figured a desert trip would have to wait. To our surprise, Peter’s sister and brother-in-law surprised us with a fun Palm Springs getaway and just like that we were off the desert!

As I am sure you could have already guessed, I was totally obsessed. Every detail from the Jonathan Adler decor, to the Alice & Wonderland vibes made this place so special. It was the perfect way to close out an epic summer, and encourage you all to visit this little piece of desert heaven!

xoxo
