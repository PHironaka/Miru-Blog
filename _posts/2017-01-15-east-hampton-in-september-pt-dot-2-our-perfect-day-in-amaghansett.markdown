 We got an early start in the morning every day order to take full advantage of the flawless weather we were experiencing, which is a rarity on Long Island. We started the day getting egg sandwiches to go from Goldberg's Famous Bagels, which is situated alongside the Montauk Highway on the eastern end of Amagansett. With sandwiches in hand, we quickly headed back into town to pick up a coffee to go at Jack Stir Coffee Shop. From there, we make the quick drive down to Indian Wells beach, where we scarfed down our sandwiches and made our way into the Ocean for some much needed body surfing (or at least I did). 

There's something so perfect about the beaches in East Hampton. The sand is soft but not too soft. The water in September, which was when we were there, is a perfect temperature. And since we were there a week after Labor Day, we missed all the summer crowds, so basically what I'm saying is that everything was perfect. 

We worked up enough of an appetite for our next meal: Lobster Roll...

Buttery goodness everyone should experience at least once in their life. The Lobster Roll at Lobster Roll is a food group onto itself. Truth be told, we ate here a total of 3 times during our 5 days out on the East End.

To close out the afternoon, we headed back into downtown of Amagansett for a little light shopping. Amagansett Square has a number of great stores. It's basically LA's version of the Brentwood Country Mart. Our favorite store was Pilgrim Surf Supply. All the products they sell are well designed and are of high quality.

We drove back to our Airbnb to get cleaned up before dinner. The weather was still so perfect, so before we headed to the restaurant we were going to dine at, we decided to make one more stop at Indian Wells to catch the sunset. As indicated by the photos below, we made the right choice, it was a perfect ending to a perfect day.
