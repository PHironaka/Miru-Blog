As I get older, something that I have become more passionate about is architecture and home design. If you follow me on Pinterest, you’ll know that I particularly love modern and mid-century design. This past weekend, Peter and I had some friends in town and decided to take our guests to see the historic Eames House.

Charles and Ray Eames are best known for their groundbreaking contributions to architecture, furniture design, industrial design and manufacturing, and the photographic arts. Charles and Ray wanted to build a home that make no demands for itself, and would serve as a background for, as Charles said, “life in work,” with nature as a “shock absorber.”

The house was absolutely incredible and even more special since it was kept pretty much how they left it when they were living in it. Although this house is a landmark nestled in the hills of the Palisades, the work of Ray and Charles Eames lives in spaces across the world (even including our little home). Their iconic and timeless design will continue to inspire many for years to come.
