If you’ve met or talked to me in the last six months since I’ve move to California, I can guarantee I’ve talked to you about Ojai. Every now and then in life you find a place that makes your heart happy and soul feel good. That place for me is Ojai Valley Inn & Spa.

A few month’s ago, Peter's sister planned a trip here for their dad’s birthday. Nestled back in the quiet hills, Ojai Valley Inn & Spa is the perfect weekend retreat for family, friends, or girls trip. The spa services are one of a kind, and everything they do there feels special, even the small piece of fresh lavender they leave on your towel before you head in for a treatment. The beautiful architecture, wild growing flowers, and fresh air, make it feel like a little piece of heaven.

One of my favorite spots at the resort is the herb garden pool. It’s always just warm enough when laying out, and so nice to take a stroll through the herb garden after. Fun fact if you know any golfers, Seven Senior PGA Tournaments were held at the Inn from the 80’s-90’s. As you can see, the course is still pristine, and per Peter, fun to play on. I loved this place so much that I ended up visiting again in January with my mom and aunt for her birthday. Occasion or no occasion, you won’t regret taking a visit here, it may end up being your new happy place!
