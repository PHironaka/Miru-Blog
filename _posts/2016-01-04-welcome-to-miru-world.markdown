Hello folks, and welcome to Miru!

We just dropped the welcome mat on our new internet abode, and we couldn't be more excited to share our travel adventures and experiences with the world. If you're anything like us, then you know how important it is to travel outside of your comfort zone. To find the road less traveled, and to experiences different parts of the world you don't often see. That, in a nutshell, is what we strive for in Miru.

Our pension for travel has been an important element of our lives, and with this blog, we're aiming to open up our experiences with the viewing public. It will allow us to reflect on those important moments we share together, whether that be crossing Shibuya station or scaling Half Dome on a hot summer day. It opens up the possibilities to enhance those moments long after they transpired. That's what excites me the most.

As you can probably tell, we've started out posting about a few archived trips here and there which should give you an idea of a. our current writing prowess (yikes) and b. the style of storytelling we're currently zoned in on. We're by no means locked in on any set formula, but given our current geo location and how we like to plan for upcoming trips, we'll probably be covering these areas in the months to come:

# LA Living
This is our home. We live in Venice, CA and are constantly in awe of its beauty. The great thing about LA is that it's a huge city with endless amounts of fun to be had.

# Weekend Trips
Another benefit of living in LA and California for that matter is the proximity to cool places. Palm Springs, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Vegas, Ojai. All within a 4hr drive.

# Domestic
Wheels up time. We have about a handful of upcoming trips across the country, which should make for some good times and excellent adventures.

# Global Crusades
The possibilities are endless ðŸŒŽ

And with that, we begin...
