Palm Springs in April is perfect weather. Perfect. Like, 80 degree and not a breath of wind I'm living in a perfect sphere of warm sunshine perfect. Kam and I were lucky enough to beat the Coachella crowd a few weeks ago for a quiet night in the desert, which was just what the doctor prescribed.

We pick our accommodations between different AirBnB options and whatever the best hotel deal there is. Because it was on the eve of my birthday, we decided to splurge a little bit and stay at Sparrows Lodge, which is situated between The Ace & The Parker, conveniently located just a few minutes away from downtown Palm Canyon drive.
