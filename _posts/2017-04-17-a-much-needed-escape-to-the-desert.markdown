Palm Springs in April is perfect weather. Perfect. Like, 80 degree and not a breath of wind I'm living in a perfect sphere of warm sunshine perfect. Kam and I were lucky enough to beat the Coachella crowd a few weeks ago for a quiet night in the desert, which was just what the doctor prescribed.

We pick our accommodations between different AirBnB options and whatever the best hotel deal there is. Because it was on the eve of my birthday, we decided to splurge a little bit and stay at Sparrows Lodge, which is situated between The Ace & The Parker, conveniently located just a few minutes away from downtown Palm Canyon drive. This was our first time at Sparrows, and I truly hope it will not be our last. It was a perfect place to suit our needs. There is a total of 20-30 rooms at the hotel. It has a quaint, almost Bed and Breakfast type vibe to it. Overall, I was most impressed with the presentation. Everything from the arrival to all the design details in the room were very well thought out, and it didn't seem like they broke the bank. 

While were were enjoying life at Sparrows, it was time for the next activity.
