Kicking things off proper with a closer look at one of my favorite places in the world: The Historical Venice Canals. Now, for everyone who hasn't had the opportunity to take a leisurely stroll alongside the canals, here's the skinny on what makes it so special.

Over 100 years ago, real estate developer bad man Abbott Kinney came up with the idea of creating a "Venice of The Americas". With that, the canals would serve as a miniaturized replica of the Italian version, complete with Gondolas and Gondoliers. And while Kinney's vision didn't exactly come to fruition, the Canals have become somewhat of a hidden gem in the city. There's virtually no street traffic, which makes it a great place for a stroll with family and friends.

The Canals extend from Venice Blvd all the way to the west side of Washington, which is approximately 2 miles. The area itself is predominately residential, along with a fun little park equipped with a duck play pond. I typically walk through the canals on my way to the beach. Insider tip: if you're visiting from out of town and have a car, try parking on the North side. Parking on Pacific is usually a bear, and you'll have more directional options to take.
