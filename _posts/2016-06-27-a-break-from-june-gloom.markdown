This is the one time during the calendar year Angelenos are allowed to complain about the weather. Why is this marine layer still here at 3pm? What is this cold breeze in the air? 65 degrees, are you kidding me? June gloom has been a mainstay all month, and while the rest of the country has been experiencing "summery" conditions, everyone else in the greater 90291 region has been meyered in weeks of dreary weather.

Last Monday was the first week of Summer, and with that, our first glimmer of hope. Temperatures reached into the 80s, and with that, we decided to head outdoors for some fun in the sun. Weekend activities included a 7-mile hike along the Los Liones Trailhead in Pacific Palisades, an afternoon dip in the ocean, and a few hours at LACMA to close out the weekend.
