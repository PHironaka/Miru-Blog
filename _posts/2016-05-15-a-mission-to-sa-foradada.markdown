<<<<<<< HEAD

Once we finished our morning walk through town, it was on to the next activity: lunch. We got in our cars and headed north along the coast with our destination being between Valldemossa and Deia. The name of the restaurant is Sa Foradada, which has recently risen to fame due to high praise from the likes of The New York Times and [The Selby](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/edible-selby-fire-island/?_r=0). For those of you who aren't too familiar with Sa Foradada, it's not the the type of restaurant you can just stroll into, order paella and einsemada and be on your merry way. Arriving at the place is half the battle, it's an adventure. Patrons have two ways of arrival: by sail or by foot. We definitely didn't have a boat, so we hoofed it down the steep trail all the way to the restaurant. It ended up taking about an hour each way, approximately two miles with a 1,400ft elevation change from start to finish. Good thing we all packed running shoes!

The hike down to the restaurant was an adventure onto itself. The parking lot is situated at the very top of the mountainside, which is directly above one of the most picture esque vistas along the. As we began our descent down the steep hill, we passed a beatuiful rustic old mansion called Son Marroig. The manor was built in the 19th century and served as a private residence to the Austrian Habsburgs.

Everyone likes bread. Right? Well, if you're one of those health nuts that only eats kale, please change the channel as I wax poetic on my favorite neighborhood spot: Superba Food & Bread. It's situated on the corner of Lincoln and Marco PL, which is a few hundred yards from my home. It's my go-to spot for a morning Croissant and Coffee.

LA Restauranteur and Dogtown Resident Paul Hibler opened Superba's doors in 2014, offering an assortment of Cafe, bakery and comfort foods. Their menu offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner options. The space, which was designed by Catherine Johnson and Rebecca Rudolph (also developed Superba's brand identity), is pretty unique in that the café is located in a separate area from the kitchen and bakery. There's a fun, youthful, vibrant energy that ruminates throughout the restaurant. Pops of green can be seen on the glass bakery display as well as on the tables and exterior of the kitchen.

And the food? Well, let me just say there's something for everyone. If you've had a morning workout and feel like indulging in some coma inducing sugary sustenance, look no further than the Lots of Grain Hotcake. It's one of the most savory most delicious things I've ever eaten. My other favorite's are: And the food? Well, let me just say there's something for everyone.
