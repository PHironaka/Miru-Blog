Once we finished our morning walk through town, it was on to the next activity: lunch. We got in our cars and headed north along the coast with our destination being between Valldemossa and Deia. The name of the restaurant is Sa Foradada, which has recently risen to fame due to high praise from the likes of The New York Times and [The Selby](http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/edible-selby-fire-island/?_r=0). For those of you who aren't too familiar with Sa Foradada, it's not the the type of restaurant you can just stroll into, order paella and einsemada and be on your merry way. Arriving at the place is half the battle, it's an adventure. Patrons have two ways of arrival: by sail or by foot. We definitely didn't have a boat, so we hoofed it down the steep trail all the way to the restaurant. It ended up taking about an hour each way, approximately two miles with a 1,400ft elevation change from start to finish. Good thing we all packed running shoes!

The hike down to the restaurant was an adventure onto itself. The parking lot is situated at the very top of the mountainside, which is directly above one of the most picturesque vistas along the western coast of Mallorca. Before beginning our descent down the steep hill, we passed a beautiful rustic old mansion called Son Marroig. The manor was built in the 19th century and served as a private residence to the Austrian Habsburgs. With it's magnificant stone construction and endless views of the Mediterranean, it was definitely one of the prettiest homes we saw along our trip. As a matter of fact, there was actually a wedding reception being held the day we walked the trail.

A few yards up the road was the entrance to the Foradada trail. The word 'entrance' is used very loosely, in that we had to actually hop a fence over a locked gate in order to get through. There's photo evidence of the maneuver but due to extreme levels of embarrassment from multiple family members, I've decided to keep those documents private (for now). The hike down the mountain was beyond breathtaking. We passed by wild donkeys, goats, and the vistas at every turn seemed to be more stunning than the previous.

The one thing that struck me more than anything else was the vast peacefulness of the Mediterranean. There were at least 3 or 4 times while we made our descent that I had to take a moment and just appreciate the sheer size and significance of the sea. So clear you could see to the bottom of the floor from hundreds of yards away. There were no jet skis, no party boats. Just one or two sail boats out in the sea. To say it was a special experience would be a gross understatement. It's such a remote area of the world. If you turned back the clocks a couple hundred years ago, probably not that much has changed. There were maybe 2- or 3 people we passed along the way. Pro tip: If you plan to hike the trail to Foradada, be sure to wear a pair of running or cross trainer sneakers. The elevation changes are surprisingly steep. The stone and gravel was pretty loose when we walked down it, which made it easy to trip or roll one of your ankles. Just be careful as you take in the majestic scenery.

After about an hour of hiking, we finally made it to sea level, where it was just a short walk around the peninsula to the restaurant. Upon arrival, it was clear how special this lunch was going to be. The restaurant is literally built into the side of a cliff, which overhangs a small cove where boats can dock while getting a bite to eat. Simply put: it was a once in a lifetime experience. And when you're lucky enough to experience something as special as lunch at Sa Foradada, you need to take full advantage of the opportunity, which is exactly what we did.  

Sa Foradada has been in business for over 40 years, and during that time, not a whole lot has changed about the place. It's still a family run restaurant, owned by the great Emilio Fern√°ndez and his daughter, Lidia. The paella is cooked over an open fire, and all the fish is caught fresh locally in the surrounding Mallorcan sea. That's it. There's no fancy equipment or anything really. Just fire, ingredients and pots and pans. Oh and in case you were wondering, the food was fabulous. In true Hironaka fashion, we ordered not one but two large family style seafood paella dishes for the six of us. Even though we were all starving after the hike, the salty dishes filled us up to the brim and we were set for the next few hours. Well, at least until we made it back to our cars which was another 2 miles straight back up the mountain!
