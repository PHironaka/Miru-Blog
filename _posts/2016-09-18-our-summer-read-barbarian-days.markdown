OK, so it's been a hot minute or so since we last updated the blog. My apologies for that. I could give you the litany of bs as to why you haven't heard a peep in 3 months, but that would just be a waste of your time. One thing that's for certain is we packed in a couple great trips in the past few weeks, looking forward to sharing that with you in the coming days. But first, I wanted to acknowledge our favorite book from the summer.

William Finnegan has been a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine for over 20 years, and with a lifetime of reporting experience, it's no surprise that his memoir "Barbarian Days: A Surfing life" is a great read. Barbarian Days traverses through all of Finnegan's life: from growing up on Diamond Head on Oahu, to his time spent in Apartheid ridden South Africa. Between surviving illness in the South Pacific and his current residence on the Upper East Side, one thing remains true: searching for the perfect wave.
