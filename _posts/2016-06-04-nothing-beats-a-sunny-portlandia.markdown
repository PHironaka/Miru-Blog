Sunshine has a profound effect on people's moods and outlook on the world. As a resident of Venice for over 1 1/2 years, I've become spoiled by countless days of sunshine and perfect 75 degree weather. It's true, I'm soft. And anytime I venture outside my little bubble, like say this past weekend when I went to Portland, I'm reminded of the emotional and spiritual impact good weather can bring a community. Once the sun comes out in Portland, it's game over. There are few places in the world as beautiful as Portland is on a sunny day. And the best part: everyone is happy.

It was my first time in Portlandia since I made the move to LA, and I was instantly reminded why I loved living there so much. The great food, friends, and small town vibe permeating at every corner. Here's a few of the highlights and pitstops we made along our trip:

# Nike Employee Store

Everyone remembers their first visit to the NES. I can still recall the anticipation of making my maiden voyage to Nikeland. I had just moved out to Portland to start work at Wieden + Kennedy and was chomping at the bit to make the short drive over to Beaverton.

While the allure of the experience has faded in recent years, it's still has its special place in my sneakerhead's heart. Like Highlander, there can only be one. Employee.Store.

# St. Johns and UP Campus

On Saturday, we got to drive around St. Johns neighborhood, including the University of Portland campus. Kam's old stomping grounds. We drove by her old house she lived in when she was a member of the UP Pilot Track and Field team. If you're in the area and in need of some spicey Thai food, look no further than Thai Ginger. Easily the best Pad Thai in Portland.

# Floyds Coffee Shop

This was my neighborhood coffee shop in SE Portland. There's nothing really hip or special about the place, which is kind of why I loved it so much. The coffee is really good too, and it's a just a few blocks up the street from my old apartment. We were joined by a few good friends as we enjoyed the morning sunshine and good conversation.
